gratefuldev
===========

Rails application that will showcase developing a single page javascript application
using Backbone, Marionette and Underscore using coffeescript and eco templates. 

We will build it using the Grateful Dead live recording data collected over 
thirty years from 1965 through 1995. The application will allow user to search 
songs played, venues, cities and lookup shows by date, country, city, state, 
songs played or venue.

Rails is used to provide the API to the data, and to package and maintain 
JS and CSS assets when it comes time to deploy.

Will utilize the [gdshowsdb](https://github.com/jefmsmit/gdshowsdb) gem created by [jefmsmit](https://github.com/jefmsmit)
